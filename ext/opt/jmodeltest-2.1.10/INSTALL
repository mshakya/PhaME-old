Basic Installation
==================

No proper installation is required. However, you should keep in mind the following:

1. Decompress the tarball

   Your OS might allow you to execute jar files directly from the compressed file.
   However, this will probably lead to errors if PhyML binaries cannot be executed
   or temporary files cannot be created.

   In Linux/OS X from command console:

      $ tar zvxf jmodeltest-2.1.x-yyyymmdd.tar.gz

2. GUI: Run jModelTest.jar, either double clicking or from a command console:

      $ cd $JMODELTEST_HOME
      $ java -jar jModelTest.jar

3. COMMAND LINE: Run jModelTest.jar with -help argument for information about the
   arguments:

      $ java -jar jModelTest.jar -help

4. Check the README file or the pdf manual (available at the homepage)
